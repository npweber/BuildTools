# BuildTools

BuildTools was a utility to aid build development of Spigot plugins. Once the latest plugin version was built in the target directory, BuildTools would search for the build and copy it to the plugins subdirectory in the Spigot server directory. It would then proceed to execute the Spigot server jar process, wrapped in IntellJ for convivence, allowing for testing of the plugins. This was utilized in 2016-17, when I only developed Spigot plugins.
